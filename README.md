# Build 'n Command Prototyping

## Core concepts

1. ### Build

Build infrastructure to support your military campaign. Your ultimate goal is conquering your enemy, but to achieve this you need resources and technology. Build buildings that *gather resources*, *refines resources*, *crafts equipment* and *serves* your troops.

2. ### Recruit

Your army needs soldiers. To begin with, your only fighting troops will be riflemen. As your factories start outputting more weapons and machinery, you will be able to give your recruits other roles, and your army will have mode specialised troops.

3. ### Command

Send your recruits to the frontlines. Build outposts with armories to supply your troops with weapons. Organise your troops in teams, squads, platoons and companies. Request troop movements, station barricades and hope your troops fight with honour.
